**THIS LIBRARY IS NO LONGER MAINTAINED**

## What is Goat?

Goat is a golang SDK for auth0 API.

It tries to answer the lack of SDK in golang for auth0.
Currently most of the users method have been implemented but some methods are still missing optional parameters.

## Getting started

To get started, first make sure you've properly set up your Golang environment and then run the
```bash
$ go get github.com/cycloidio/goat/auth0
```
to get the latest version of the [goat](https://github.com/cycloidio/goat/).

### Initialisation

In order to use the SDK:
```go
import 	"github.com/cycloidio/goat/auth0"

var auth0Domain = "https://cycloid.eu.auth0.com" // your auth0 domain
var auth0APIBasePath = "/api/v2"                 // the API base path
var auth0Token = "XXXXXX"                        // the token you want to use

var auth0 = goat.NewAuth0(auth0Domain, auth0APIBasePath, auth0Token)
```

The idea behind the token variable is to be able to use different tokens, based on your needs instead of having a token that can do everything. 

### Calls

You can then call any of the methods that have been implemented or call arbitrary a method via the `Call` method.
Example of re-implementing the `GetUser` method:

```go
// This method
json, err := auth0.GetUser("github|testing-user")
// is identical to
json, err := auth0.Call("/users/github|testing-user", http.MethodGet, nil)
```
